# DExTer (Debugging Experience Tester)

## Introduction

DExTer is a suite of tools used to evaluate the "User Debugging Experience". DExTer drives an external debugger, running on small test programs, and collects information on the behavior at each debugger step to provide quantitative values that indicate the quality of the debugging experience.

DExTer is now part of the LLVM project. This repository only exists for the purposes of historical record. DExTer's canonical home is now in [LLVM's github repository](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/cross-project-tests/debuginfo-tests/dexter).
