Skipped over fold value compare, pretty certain it's somewhere already,
but is potentially a coverage hole

Also SimplifyTerminatorOnSelect, which is effectively just deleting BBs that
have been const-prop'd away

Similar with SimplifyIndirectBrOnSelect, I'm not aware of how one accesses
such a construct from C++, sounds block-extension-y

And SimplifyBranchOnICmpChain, the example IR all relies on direct use of
i1's, while everything from C++ uses i8's for bools, so I can't believe this
ever triggers for C++ tests

Skipped all the resume things because no-one who cares about performance is
going to be using exceptions

Can't test 'unreachable' paths because theyre... unreachable

eliminateDeadSwitchCases also isn't something that we can really test,
because fundementally you're testing correctness first there

Probably don't have full coverage of all the things the switching code can do,
but I can't convince it to cough up things like a bitmask-switch.
