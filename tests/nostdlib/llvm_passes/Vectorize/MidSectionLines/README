I can't currently think up a good way to represent this in dexter: we
get line numbers on the "middle section" of the vectorized loop, i.e.
where the loop reduction variable is moved back to a scalar register to
optionally go around the scalar portion of the loop. Those lines just
lead to misleading behaviours; but given that during the vectorized
part of the loop we bounce randomly around lines (due to ILP I suspect)
it's difficult to write a robust test (IMO) saying what line numbers
we _should_ step over.
